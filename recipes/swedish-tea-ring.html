    is swirled with brown sugar, cinnamon, and walnuts and topped with pearl sugar. This is the perfect sweet treat to

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>For the Dough</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>4¼ cups bread flour</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons fast-action yeast</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>⅓ cup caster sugar</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1¼ cup whole milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For the Filling</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tablespoons salted butter, softened</li>
    <li>½ cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
    <li>2½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>½ cup walnuts, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For the Topping</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons pearl sugar</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <h4>Making the Dough</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Scald the milk by bringing to a boil over medium heat. Let it cool to 115 F before using.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt the butter in the microwave and let it cool slightly. Measure out the other ingredients.</li>
    <li>Pour the flour into a large mixing bowl, adding the salt and yeast on opposite sides of the bowl. Mix each one
      in with your finger.</li>
    <li>Stir in the sugar and ground cardamom, then add the eggs and melted butter. Mix until a dough forms, then
      gradually add the milk and mix until no flour remains in the bowl.</li>
    <li>Knead until smooth, about 10-15 minutes. Check to see if it is kneaded enough by doing the windowpane test.
      Break off a lump and stretch it between the thumb and forefinger of each hand to create a windowpane shape. The
      dough should stretch to be translucent without breaking; if it does, knead for a minute longer and check again.
    </li>
    <li>Shape into a tight ball, place in a buttered bowl, and set aside to prove in a warm place until at least doubled
      in size, about 1 hour.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Shaping the Tea Ring</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and punch it down all over to knock out the air pockets. Use a
      rolling pin to shape it into a 13x17 inch rectangle.</li>
    <li>Spread the softened butter on top with a pastry brush or angled spatula. Mix together the brown sugar and
      cinnamon, then spread evenly over the buttered dough. Scatter the chopped walnuts on top, pressing them in
      lightly.</li>
    <li>Tightly roll up the dough from one of the long sides to create a log. Pinch the seam and ends to seal, then
      shape the log into a circle and firmly squeeze the ends together. Place the wreath on a large baking stone or
      parchment-lined cookie sheet.</li>
    <li>Use clean kitchen shears to snip just over halfway through the log every inch or so. Once you've gone all the
      way around, lean the slices over and fan them out to display the swirled interior.</li>
    <li>Cover the loaf with plastic wrap and place in a warm place to prove. The dough is ready to bake when it springs
      back quickly when gently prodded with a fingertip.</li>
    <li>About 10 minutes before it is ready, preheat the oven to 400 F.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Decorating & Baking the Tea Ring</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Once the tea ring has proved, brush the top of each swirl and the inside of the circle with beaten egg. There's
      no need to egg wash the swirled part of the bread. Sprinkle generously with pearl sugar.</li>
    <li>Bake the bread at 400 F for 10 minutes, then lower the heat to 375 F and bake for 13-15 minutes, until the bread
      is well browned and has an internal temperature of at least 190 F on a meat thermometer. Watch the bread carefully
      and cover with a sheet of foil if it's getting too dark.</li>
    <li>Let the bread cool for 10 minutes on the pan, then transfer to a wire rack and allow it to cool completely
      before slicing and serving.</li>
  </ol>
