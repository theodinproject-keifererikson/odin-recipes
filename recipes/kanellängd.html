      <li>3¾ cups bread flour</li>
      <li>2¼ teaspoons fast-action yeast</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>

      <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

      <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Decoration</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large egg, for glazing</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons orange marmalade</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon clementine zest, from 1 clementine</li>
      <li>½ cup powdered sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons orange juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Making the Dough (30 min + 1 hr proving)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir the butter and milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until the
        butter has melted and the mixture is warm. Let the mixture cool to 115
        F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the salt and yeast on
        opposite sides of the bowl, stirring in each with your finger. Add the
        ground cardamom and caster sugar and stir the whole mix together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the egg and half of the milk mixture. Mix on low speed with the
        paddle attachment. Gradually add more milk as the mixer runs until a
        soft, somewhat sticky dough is formed and all of the flour is picked up
        from the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch attachments to the hook and knead until the dough is smooth, not
        as sticky, and has cleaned the sides of the bowl. It must also pass the
        windowpane test. Break off a lump of dough and stretch it between your
        hands to form a windowpane shape. If it stretches until translucent
        without breaking, it's been kneaded enough; if it breaks, knead for a
        minute longer and check again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape into a ball, place in a lightly buttered bowl, and cover tightly
        with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a cold oven and put a pan of
        boiling water on the shelf below to create a warm, steamy atmosphere.
        Let it rise until doubled in size, about 1 to 1 ½ hours.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Preparing the Filling (10 min)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix together the sugar, cinnamon, and cardamom in a medium bowl until
        thoroughly mixed, then set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream the butter and vanilla extract until all the vanilla is
        incorporated. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shaping (20 min + 30 min proving)Prepare a 11 by 17 inch rimmed cookie
        sheet by lining it with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knock it back by
        punching it down all over. Roll it out thinly into a large rectangle,
        about 12 by 15 inches. A larger rectangle means a larger loaf and more
        swirls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the vanilla butter evenly all over the dough, then sprinkle the
        cinnamon-sugar mixture evenly all over the butter with a small sieve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Starting with the long edge closest to you, roll up the dough very
        tightly. Pull the roll towards you as you go to stretch the dough and
        create a taut roll. Pinch the seam underneath and the ends to seal, then
        place it on the prepared cookie sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a sharp, clean pair of kitchen scissors, snip the log every ¾ of
        an inch, cutting almost all the way through. Pull out the slices,
        alternating sides. Flatten the slices slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the cookie sheet inside a clean plastic garbage bag, tucking the
        excess under the pan. Leave the dough to prove until the dough springs
        back when lightly pressed with a fingertip, about for 30-45 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Baking (25 min + cooling)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        About 15 minutes before the bread is done proving, preheat the oven to
        415 F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the kanellängd all over with the beaten egg and trim off the
        excess parchment paper, as it will turn brown in the oven. Stack the
        cookie sheet on top of another cookie sheet to insulate the bottom of
        the bread, helping it not to burn as quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake it in the middle of a 415 F oven for 25-30 minutes. Watch the bread
        closely, and cover it with foil after 10 minutes if it's getting too
        dark. Let it cool completely on a wire rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Decorating (15 min)</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Zest a clementine.</li>
      <li>
        Sift the powdered sugar into a medium bowl and stir in enough orange
        juice to make a pourable icing. Spoon the icing into a corner of a
        plastic sandwich bag, twist the top, and snip off the corner to make a
        piping bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the sieved marmalade all over the bread, then drizzle with the
        orange icing. Sprinkle the clementine zest over the loaf. Serve in large
        slices.
      </li>
    </ol>
