    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup + 1 tablespoon whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons fine salt</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons fast-action yeast</li>
      <li>5 cups bread flour</li>
      <li>1 large egg white, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons pearl sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <h4>Making the Dough</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, then pour in the
        milk and stir until the mixture reaches 115°F. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the milk mixture, sugar,
        cardamom, and salt. Whisk until well combined, then sprinkle in the
        yeast and whisk again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually mix in the flour with your hand until a soft, somewhat sticky
        dough has formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead the dough briefly in the bowl, then turn it out onto a floured
        surface and knead for 10-15 minutes until the dough is no longer so
        sticky and is smooth and elastic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the dough into a ball, place in a lightly buttered bowl, and cover
        tightly with plastic wrap. Place the dough in a warm place and let it
        prove until doubled in size, about 1 ½ to 2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Shaping</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line a large, light-colored metal cookie sheet with parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down the dough, then divide it into 4 equal pieces (243g each),
        using a kitchen scale for accuracy. Roll each piece of dough into a rope
        2 feet long. Be sure not to use a floured surface during this step. If
        the dough isn't rolling easily, let it rest for a few minutes, then come
        back to it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the four strands side by side and join them together at the top,
        then start a four-strand braid. Think of the strands of being numbered
        from 1 to 4, from left to right. Bring 4 over 3, then bring 2 over 1.
        Cross the new strand 2 over strand 3. Repeat this sequence until the
        whole loaf is plaited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tuck the ends of the plait underneath the loaf and transfer it to the
        prepared cookie sheet. Cover and let it rise until the dough springs
        back quickly when gently prodded with a fingertip, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 15 minutes before the dough has finished proving, preheat the oven
        to 375°F.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Decorating & Baking</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brush the loaf with the lightly beaten egg white and sprinkle with pearl
        sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake at 375°F for 15 minutes, then lower the temperature to 300°F and
        bake for another 10-15 minutes. Cover the loaf with a piece of aluminum
        foil once it is nicely browned. The bread is done when it has an
        internal temperature of 190°F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the bread cool completely on a wire rack before eating. Slice and
        serve with salted butter and coffee.
      </li>
    </ol>
